\usage{
hbal(data, Treat, X, Y, base.weight = NULL, coefs = NULL ,
     max.iterations = 200, cv = TRUE, folds = 4, 
     expand.degree = 3, ds = FALSE, alpha = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dataframe that contains the treatment, outcome, and covariates.}

\item{Treat}{a character string of the treatment variable.}

\item{X}{a character vector of covariate names to balance on.}

\item{Y}{a character string of the outcome variable.}

\item{base.weight}{target weight distribution for the control units.}

\item{coefs}{initial coefficients for the reweighting algorithm (lambdas).}

\item{max.iterations}{maximum number of iterations. Default is 200.}

\item{cv}{whether to use cross validation. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{folds}{number of folds for cross validation. Only used when cv is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{expand.degree}{degree of series expansion. 0 means no expansion. Default is 3.}

\item{ds}{whether to perform double selection prior to balancing. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{alpha}{named vector of ridge penalties.}

\item{group.alpha}{binary indicator of whether each covariate group should be penalized.}

\item{constraint.tolerance}{tolerance level for overall imbalance. Default is 1e-3.}

\item{print.level}{details of printed output.}

\item{grouping}{different groupings of the covariates. Must be specified if expand is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{shuffle.treat}{whether to use cross-validation on the treated units. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{exclude}{list of covariate name pairs or triplets to be excluded.}

\item{seed}{random seed to be set. Set random seed when cv=\code{TRUE} for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
An list object of class \code{hbal} with the following elements:
\item{coefs}{vector that contains coefficients from the reweighting algorithm.}
\item{mat}{matrix of serially expanded covariates if expand=\code{TRUE}. Otherwise, the original covariate matrix is returned.}
\item{penalty}{vector of ridge penalties used for each covariate} 
\item{weights}{vector that contains the control group weights assigned by hbal.}
\item{W}{vector of treatment status}
\item{Y}{vector of outcome}
}
\description{
\code{hbal} performs hierarchically regularized entropy balancing 
such that the covariate distributions of the control group match those of the 
treatment group. \code{hbal} automatically expands the covariate space to include
higher order terms and uses cross-validation to select variable penalties for the 
balancing conditions.

hbal performs hierarchically regularized entropy balancing such that the covariate distributions of the control group match those of the treatment group. hbal automatically expands the covariate space to include higher order terms and uses cross-validation to select variable penalties for the balancing conditions.
}
\details{
In the simplest set-up, user can just pass in \{Treatment, X, Y\}. The default settings will serially expand
X to include higher order terms, hierarchically residualize these terms, perform double selection to only keep the relevant
variables and use cross-validation to select penalities for different groupings of the covariates.
