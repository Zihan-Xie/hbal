This page demonstrates the usage of the **hbal** package, which implements hierarchically regularized entropy balancing introduced by @XuYang2022.  **hbal** automatically expands the covariate space to include higher order terms and uses cross-validation to select variable penalties for the balancing conditions, and then seek approximate balance on the expanded covariate space. 

**hbal** provides two main functions:

* `hbal`, which performs hierarchically regularized entropy balancing.

* `att`, which calculates the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) from an `hbalobject` returned by `hbal`. 


***

## 1. Balancing Covariates

We simulate a toy cross-sectional dataset with a binary treatment to illustrate the basic usage of **hbal**. 
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(hbal)
set.seed(1984)
N <- 500
X1 <- rnorm(N)
X2 <- rbinom(N,size=1,prob=.5)
X <- cbind(X1, X2) # Covariates
D <- rbinom(N, 1, prob=0.5) # Treatment indicator
y <- 0.5 * D + X[,1] + X[,2] + rnorm(N) # Outcome
```

In the simplest use case, we can use the following two lines of code to:

1. Bbalance the covariates (up to the third moments) between the treatmeant and control groups.

2. estimate the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT).

```{r}
out <- hbal(Treatment = D, X = X,  Y = y)
summary(hbal::att(out))
```

We can see that, by default, `hbal` balances on an expanded covariate set that includes second- and third-order polynomials of the covariates. 

`att` uses linear regression with robust standard errors (`lm_robust` from the **estimatr** package) to calculate the ATT. Additional arguments accepted by `lm_robust`, such as clusters, can be passed to `att()`.

`hbal` returns a list of 9 objects:

```{r}
str(out)
```
1. **converged**: Binary indicator of whether the algorithm has converged.
2. **weights**: Solution weights. Can be plugged into any downstream estimator.
3. **coefs**: Values of Lagrangian multipliers. They are used to calculate the solution `weights`.
4. **Treatment**: Treatment indicator. Reproduced here to be used by `att()`.
5. **Y**: Outcome variable. Reproduced here to be used by `att()`.
6. **mat**: Expanded covariates matrix.
7. **group.assignment**: A vector of the number of variabels in each covariate group.
8. **penalty**: This is the regularization parameter $\alpha$ in  Xu \& Yang (2021).
9. **call**: A string of the function call.


***
## 2. Visualizing Results

**hbal** has a build-in `plot` method that allows us to visualize covariate balance before and after balancing.

```{r, fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 9, fig.align = "left"}
plot(out)
```

We can see that the linear terms (mean) of the covariates are exactly balanced between the treatment and the control groups. We can check the penalties applied to different groups of covariates. In this case, the higher-order terms also have relatively low penalties, and imbalance among higher-order terms is significantly reduced. 

```{r}
out$penalty
```

We can also plot the weight distribution for the control units by specifying `type = 'weight'` in `plot`. We can see that the weights are quite evenly distributed around the unit weight.

```{r}
plot(out, type='weight')
```

## 3. Expirical Example

To illustrate how **hbal** works in empirical settings, we use a dataset from @black2016courting, in which the authors study the effect of promotion prospect to the Supreme Court on the behavior of circuit court judges. Here we focus on whether circuit court judges who are on the shortlist to fill Supreme Court vacancies ("contenders") ruled in line with the president as the outcome of interest. We load the dataset `contenderJudges`, which is shipped with **hbal**:
```{r}
data("contenderJudges")
str(contenderJudges)
```

First, we take a look at the data structure. The outcome variable is `presIdeoVote` and the treatment variable is `treatFinal0`, indicating whether there was a Supreme Court vacancy at the time. There are also 7 covariates on judge and court characteristics and a variable `judge` that indicates the judges' names.

We can estimate the effect of Supreme Court vacancy on judges' rulings while controlling for functions of the covariates (to the third order) by:

```{r}
out <- hbal(Treatment = contenderJudges$treatFinal0, X = contenderJudges[,3:9],  Y = contenderJudges$presIdeoVote)
summary(hbal::att(out, clusters=contenderJudges$judge))$coefficients['Treat',]
```

We see that contender judges are more likely to rule in line with the ideology of the sitting president during a Supreme Court vacancy.

We can further check covariate balance before and after balancing by checking the balance plots. Here we see that the linear terms are exactly balanced between the treatment and the control groups. Imbalance among higher-order terms and interactions are also significantly reduced.

```{r, fig.height = 9, fig.width = 9.5, fig.align = "left"}
plot(out)
```

## 4. More Options

### 4.1 Setting Series Expansion

`hbal` uses the R built-in function `poly` to include higher-order polynomials of the supplied covariates in the balancing scheme. This is controlled by the `expand.degree` argument. By default, it is set to `expand.degree = 3`, which expands the covariates to include polynomials up to the 3rd degree.

We can ask `hbal` to balance on less flexible functions of the covariates by decreasing the value of `expand.degree`, e.g. by setting `expand.degree = 2`. This may be useful when balancing on third order terms is infeasible.

***

### 4.2 Excluding Covariates

By default, `hbal` uses the R built-in `qr` to check the rank of the (expanded) covariate matrix and remove columns that are not pivots when the matrix is rank-deficient. However, if a priori we know some combinations of the covariates are nonsensical, we can exclude them explicitly by using the `exclude` argument. For example, we can exclude any interaction that involves **X1** and **X2**:

```{r}
out <- hbal(Treatment = D, Y = y, X = X, exclude=list(c("X1", "X2")))
summary(att(out)) # X1.X2 and X1.X1.X2 removed from balancing scheme
```

***

### 4.3 Custom K-fold cross-validation

By default, `hbal` uses 4-fold cross-validation. We can change to K-fold cross-validation for any arbitrary K by setting `folds = K`.

We can also disable cross-validation by setting `cv = FALSE`. No regularization will be applied in this case and `hbal` is essentially equivalent to `ebalance` from the **ebal** package.

***

### 4.4 User-supplied base weights

By default, `hbal` tries to keep the solution weights for the control units as close as possible (in an entropy sense) to a set of uniform base weights to retain information. In cases where the target distribution of the weights for the control units is not uniform weights, we can incorporate this information by supplying a vector of target weights to `base.weight`. 

For example, if we want to set the target weight distribution such that the first 100 control units have weights of $\frac{1}{2}$ while the rest of the control units have weights of 1, we can do:

***

### 4.5 Other functionalities

1. `ds`: The double selection method by @belloni2014inference. This screens the expanded covariates and only keeps those that are are predictive for the treatment assignment or the outcome. This further reduces the dimensionality of the problem. Default is set to `FALSE`.

2. `constraint.tolerance`: Convergence criterion. The optimization algorithm will stop when the maximum difference in covaraite means between the treated and the control units is below `constraint.tolerance`.

3. `shuffle.treat`: Whether treated units should be partitioned in cross-validation. Default is set to `FALSE`. If set to `TRUE`, the covariate means of the treated units will vary from fold to fold. It may be advisable to set this argument to `FALSE` if there is only a small number of treated units or if there are many outliers in the treatment group.

4. `max.iterations`: Maximum number of iterations that will be run in finding the solution weights. Default is set to 200.

## 5. Relation to **ebal**

By setting `expand.degree=0` and `cv=FALSE`, which tells `hbal` to not expand the covariate space and not use cross validation to search for regularization hyperparameters, `hbal` is equivalent to entropy balancing introduced by @hainmueller2012entropy. We can demonstrate this equivalence by showing the hbal weights are exactly the same to the ebal weights from the **ebal** package in this case, as seen in the plot below.

```{r}
library(ebal)

ebal_mean_balance <- ebalance(Treatment = D, X = X) # mean balancing only
hbal_mean_balance <- hbal(Treatment = D, X = X, Y = y, expand.degree = 0, cv = FALSE) # mean balancing only
W <- data.frame(x = hbal_mean_balance$weights*sum(D), 
                y = ebal_mean_balance$w) # store weights as x-y coordinates
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y), data = W) + geom_point() + theme_bw() + 
  labs(x="hbal weights", y="ebal weights", title="correlation between ebal and hbal weights")
```
